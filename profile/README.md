Since its formation in January of 2003 (then known as the ASC Technology Committee), the ASC Motion Imaging Technology Council has diligently pursued its objective to understand the technological sea change impacting our motion picture and television production and postproduction industries so that we might be able to effectively influence their developments in ways that best serve creative interests of filmmakers while emphasizing the cinematographer’s contribution in advancing our evolving art form.

The ASC Motion Imaging Technology Council (also known by the acronym MITC, or “My Tech”) includes numerous Committees and working groups, each with an assigned task of working on key aspects of the production and postproduction workflow. The Committees are: Advanced Imaging, Camera, DI, Digital Archive, Digital Restoration & Preservation, Lens, Metadata, Motion Imaging Workflow, Next Generation Cinema Display, Professional Monitors, SSIMWave Evaluation Working Group, UHDTV, Virtual Reality and Virtual Production.
